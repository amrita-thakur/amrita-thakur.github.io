        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> July 2023 - July 2024</p>
        <ul>
            <h3>AI-Driven Magic Progress Note and Summary Generation (Asynchealth)</h3>
            <p>I developed the Magic Progress Note Pipeline, an AI-driven solution that automates the creation of patient interview notes and summaries. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this system extracts key information from patient interviews and automatically fills predefined templates, generating comprehensive notes and session summaries. By minimizing the time clinicians spend on documentation, this solution allows for more focused patient care, improving workflow efficiency and reducing administrative burdens.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> LLM, Langchain, Azure OpenAI, Python, Firebase, Docker, Github Actions, GCP (VM, Pub/Sub, Cloud Function, Cloud Scheduler)</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> These projects contributed to the success of the mental health platform, which secured a seed round of funding between $1.5 million and $2 million. This investment underscores the value of our AI solutions in revolutionizing mental health care delivery.</p>

            <h3>Recommender System Using 9 Box Grid (Product)</h3>
            <p>I built a recommender system utilizing a 9 Box Grid framework, designed to evaluate and categorize employees based on their performance and potential. This system assists organizations in making informed decisions regarding talent management and development strategies, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and engagement.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> LLM, Langchain</p>

            <h3>Flight Risk Assessment AI Models (Product)</h3>
            <p>I developed AI models for Flight Risk Assessment to identify employees at risk of leaving the organization. By analyzing various data points and patterns, these models provide actionable insights for retention strategies, helping organizations to proactively address employee concerns and improve overall job satisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> ML, Data Analysis</p>

            <h3>Employee Well-Being Chatbot for Talent Management (Product)</h3>
            <p>I created an Employee Well-Being Chatbot using Langchain, aimed at enhancing talent management initiatives. This AI-powered chatbot provides support and resources for employees, promoting mental health and well-being within the organization. It serves as a valuable tool for fostering a positive workplace culture and supporting employees' needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> LLM, Langchain</p>

        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">Data Scientist - GritFeat Solutions</div>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Dec 2021 - June 2023</p>
        <p><strong>Client Overview: Asahi Group Holdings</strong><br>
            Asahi Group Holdings is a leading global beverage company known for its innovative product offerings and commitment to quality. The company focuses on enhancing customer experiences and driving growth through data-driven insights and strategic marketing initiatives.</p>    
        <ul>
            <h3>End-to-End Time Series Revenue Prediction System</h3>
            <p>I built an end-to-end Time Series Revenue Prediction System for Asahi Group Holdings using Databricks. This system leverages advanced time series models, including LSTM, to predict future revenue trends, providing the client with actionable insights for strategic planning and resource allocation. Additionally, I contributed to the development of an Explainable AI (XAI) Dashboard in Tableau, which evaluates post-performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to visualize data and gain insights.</p>
    
            <h3>Topic Modelling on Twitter Posts</h3>
            <p>I performed Topic Modelling on Twitter posts using BERTopic, integrating the findings into a Revenue Prediction model to uncover insights from social media interactions and better understand customer sentiments and trends.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> NLP, Topic Modelling, Segmentation, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, Tableau, Time Series Analysis, Time Series Models, LSTM, Databricks, Pyspark, SQL, BigQuery</p>

        <div class="section-title">Associate Data Scientist - GritFeat Solutions</div>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> May 2021 - Nov 2021</p>
        <ul>
            <h3>Risk Stratification System</h3>
            <p>I developed a Risk Stratification System using claims data on the AWS SageMaker platform. The objective was to identify patients who require enhanced care proactively, allowing the organization to provide better treatment and care plans from the outset. This approach aimed to avoid prolonged treatments and minimize overall costs.</p>
            <p>Utilizing historical claims data that adhered to ICD-10 codes, we focused heavily on feature engineering, analyzing various features related to procedures, diagnoses, and medications. A significant challenge arose from the one-hot encoding of this data, which led to numerous sparse matrices. To address this, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for effective feature extraction, ensuring we maximized the value derived from our dataset.</p>
            <p>After experimenting with various supervised machine learning algorithms, we determined that Gradient Boosting was the most effective model for this application, yielding the best results in risk stratification.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> Python, USA Healthcare Claims Data, AWS (S3, SageMaker).</p>
